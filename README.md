# blockify-nodejs

Blockify (see github.com/maxymania/libblockify) functionality in javascript for node-js, AND documentation and internals.

This is because *aindigo* and I decided to implement blockify in node-js,
cause i stuck in implementing a network functionality and *aindigo* proposed to use BitTorrent's DHT to find
the blocks in the network.
